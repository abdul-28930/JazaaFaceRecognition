# Jazaa Face Recognition

Jazaa Face Recognition is a Python-based application that uses computer vision techniques to recognize and verify human faces. This project is designed to be a simple yet effective tool for face detection and recognition, making use of popular libraries such as OpenCV and face_recognition.

## Table of Contents

- To be added.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects human faces in images and video streams.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies and verifies known faces from a database of stored images.
- **Live Video Recognition**: Supports real-time face recognition from webcam or video files.
- **Easy UI**: Easily understandable UI for non-tech people.
- **OpenCV Support**: Leverages OpenCV for image processing and manipulation.

## Installation

To get started with the Jazaa Face Recognition, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdul-28930/JazaaFaceRecognition.git
    cd JazaaFaceRecognition
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Face Recognition Script**:

    To run the face recognition on an image or live video feed, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python face_recognition.py --source <source>
    ```

    - Replace `<source>` with the path to the image or video file. If you want to use the webcam, set `<source>` to `0`.

2. **Add New accounts to the Database**:

    To add a new face to the recognition database, register an account and login.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- NumPy

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
```
